        <h4 style="color: sienna;">Animal Cells</h4>
    <p>Animal cells contain many organelles, which are subunits within the cell that perform specialized functions. The organelles may be membrane-bound (enclosed within a lipid bilayer) or non-membrane bound (free in the cytoplasm). Here is a list of animal cell components and organelles and their functions:</p>
                <p>
                    <b>Cell Membrane:</b> The cell membrane or plasma membrane is a selectively permeable lipid bilayer
                    that encloses the contents of the cell and regulates the transport of materials into and out of it.
                </p>
                <p><b>Cytoplasm:</b> The cytoplasm is the jelly-like fluid that gives a cell is shape and contains the
                    molecules the cell needs for its processes.
                </p>
                <p><b>Cytoskeleton:</b> The cytoskeleton is a network of protein fibers that provides structural
                    support, maintains cell shape, and enables cell movement. It is composed of three main types of
                    protein filaments: microfilaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules.
                </p>
                <p><b>Nucleus:</b> The nucleus is the control center of the cell, containing DNA and regulating gene
                    expression. It is surrounded by a double-layered nuclear envelope or nuclear membrane that has
                    nuclear pores that allow the exchange of materials between the nucleus and the cytoplasm.
                </p>
                <p><b>Nucleolus:</b> Located within the nucleus, the nucleolus is the site of pre-ribosome production.
                </p>
                <p><b>Mitochondria:</b> Often referred to as the “powerhouse” of the cell, mitochondria are responsible
                    for generating energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through cellular respiration.
                </p>
                <p><b>Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER):</b> The ER is a network of membrane-bound tubes and sacs involved in
                    the synthesis, folding, and transport of proteins and lipids. There are two types of ER: the rough
                    ER, which is studded with ribosomes and involved in protein synthesis, and the smooth ER, which is
                    responsible for lipid synthesis and detoxification.
                </p>
                <p><b>Ribosomes:</b> These small structures, composed of RNA and proteins, are the sites of protein
                    synthesis within the cell. They can be found either free-floating in the cytoplasm or attached to
                    the rough ER.
                </p>
                <p><b>Golgi Apparatus:</b> The Golgi apparatus is responsible for modifying, sorting, and packaging
                    proteins and lipids for transport to their final destinations within or outside the cell.
                </p>
                <p><b>Lysosomes:</b> Lysosomes are membrane-bound organelles containing enzymes that break down waste
                    materials and cellular debris, playing a crucial role in the recycling of cellular components.
                </p>
                <p><b>Peroxisomes:</b> These small organelles contain enzymes that neutralize toxic substances and break
                    down fatty acids, contributing to cellular detoxification and energy production.
                </p>
                <p><b>Centrosome:</b> The centrosome is an organelle found in animal cells, but not plant cells. It is a
                    small organelle near the nucleus with radiating tubules. The centrosome produces and organizes
                    microtubules and regulates cell division so that the cell contents equally divide between daughter
                    cells.
                </p>
</div>
    <div id="plantsCelltext">
        <h4 style="color: sienna;" >Plant Cells</h4>
                <p>
                    Plant cells comprise several organelles, each with unique functions vital to the cell’s operation:

                <p> <b>Cell Wall:</b> The cell wall is a rigid layer that provides support, protection, and shape to
                    the
                    cell. It consists mainly of cellulose.
                </p>
                <p>  <b>Plasma Membrane:</b> This is a semi-permeable membrane that controls the movement of substances
                    in and
                    out of the cell.
                </p>
                <p>  <b>Nucleus:</b> The nucleus is the control center of the cell, containing DNA that directs all
                    cell
                    activities. The nuclear membrane is a double-membrane structure with nuclear pores that encloses the
                    nucleus and regulates transport and communication with the cytoplasm.
                </p>
                <p>  <b>Mitochondria:</b> Often referred to as the powerhouse of the cell, mitochondria produce ATP
                    through a
                    process called cellular respiration.
                </p>
                <p>  <b>Chloroplasts:</b> These are the sites of photosynthesis, where sunlight, carbon dioxide, and
                    water
                    change into glucose and oxygen. Chloroplasts contain a green pigment called chlorophyll, which
                    captures light energy.
                </p>
                <p>  <b>Peroxisomes:</b> Plant peroxisomes perform a key role in photorespiration and produce plant
                    hormones.
                </p>
                <p>  <b>Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER):</b> ER is a network of membranous tubules and sacs where lipid
                    synthesis
                    and protein folding occur. The rough ER, studded with ribosomes, synthesizes proteins, while the
                    smooth ER performs lipid synthesis.
                </p>
                <p>  <b>Golgi Apparatus:</b> The Golgi apparatus modifies, sorts, and packages proteins and lipids for
                    transport to their final destinations within or outside the cell.
                </p>
                <p>  <b>Ribosomes:</b> These are the sites of protein synthesis. They are either free in the cytoplasm
                    or
                    bound to the ER.
                </p>
                <p>  <b>Vacuoles:</b> Plant cells contain a large central vacuole that stores water and helps maintain
                    turgor
                    pressure, supporting the cell’s structure. Druse and raphite crystals occur in some plant vacuoles.
                    These crystals of calcium oxalate and calcium carbonates deter herbivores and also store minerals
                    for the cell.
                </p>
                <p>  <b>Cytoskeleton:</b> Just like in animal cells, plant cells also contain a cytoskeleton. The
                    cytoskeleton
                    is a network of protein fibers in the cytoplasm that provides structural support and plays a key
                    role in cell division and the transport of materials within the cell.
                </p>
                <p>  <b>Plasmodesmata:</b> These are small tubes that connect plant cells to each other, allowing
                    direct
                    communication and transport of substances between them. This is a unique feature of plant cells not
                    found in animal cells.
                </p>

<p>All living this are made up of cells. This can be a unicellular (single) cell organisim like a Bacteria or 
    like a Human which is a multicellular organism with trillions of cells. Cells are the basic building blocks of life.
</p>
<div id="cell-types">
    <div id="unicellular">
        <h4>Unicellular Organisms</h4>
        <p>Unicellular organisms, such as bacteria and protists, are composed of a single cell that performs all the
            functions necessary for life. These organisms have a variety of shapes and structures, but they all share
            the basic features of a cell, including a cell membrane, cytoplasm, and genetic material. Unicellular
            organisms are able to carry out all the essential life processes, such as respiration, reproduction, and
            metabolism, within a single cell. They are found in a wide range of environments, from the deepest oceans
            to the hottest deserts, and play a crucial role in many ecosystems.
    
     
</div>

    <div id="multicellular">
        <h4>Multicellular Organisms</h4>
        <p>
            Multicellular organisms, such as plants and animals, are composed of many cells that work together to perform the various functions necessary for life. These cells are organized into tissues, organs, and organ systems, each with a specific role to play. Multicellular organisms have a greater level of complexity than unicellular organisms, with specialized cells
            performing specialized functions. This allows for a more efficient and effective use of resources, as well as the ability to carry out more complex processes. Multicellular organisms also have the ability to grow and develop, with cells dividing
            and differentiating to form the various structures and systems of the organism. This allows for a greater degree of adaptability and the ability to respond to changes in the environment.
